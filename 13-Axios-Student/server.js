// INSTRUCTIONS:

// Level 1:
// Take any movie with a word title (ex: Cinderella) as a Node argument and retrieve the year it was created

// Level 2 (More Challenging):
// Take a move with multiple words (ex: Forrest Gump) as a Node argument and retrieve the year it was created.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Include the axios npm package (Don't forget to run "npm install axios" in this folder first!)


// Grab the movieName which will always be the third node argument.


// Then run a request with axios to the OMDB API with the movie specified

// This line is just to help us debug against the actual URL.

      // The request was made and the server responded with a status code
      // that falls out of the range of 2
      
      // The request was made but no response was received
      // `error.request` is an object that comes back with details pertaining to the error that occurred.
      
      // Something happened in setting up the request that triggered an Error
